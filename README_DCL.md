### Features of index.html
The index.html file serves as the main and only page of the scheduler. It utilizes Bootstrap styling, and provides a structured and organized day planner where the user can type in the corresponding hour-blocks different tasks or reminds, save them, and find that they are still saved upon closing and refreshing the planner. There is a clear button that serves to delete all tasks saved for a certain hour. 

### Features of style.css
The style.css file remains mostly unchanged from the version on the class repository with the exception of adding styling for a .clearBtn class. This new class takes the same styling as the existing save button class.

### Features of script.js
The script.js file is built with moment.js and utilizes the user's local storage to contain saved tasks. It is commented within the file to provide context to different lines of code. Notably, there is a clear button that clears any saved tasks from local storage of that hour and displays an empty string in the task area, making it appear empty. It is likely that the author is planning to create a fixed position element that displays the current time.

### Known bugs and glitches
There actually are no known bugs and glitches at the time of this writing.
The developer has achieved utter perfection.




### Additional comments and notes
